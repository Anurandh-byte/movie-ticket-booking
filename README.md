# 🎟️ Ticket Booking System (Circular Queue)

A simple **C program** that implements a **circular queue-based ticket booking system**. This project demonstrates how queue data structures work using operations like **enqueue**, **dequeue**, and **display**, all while simulating a small passenger ticket reservation system.

***

## 📘 Features

- **Book Ticket:** Add a passenger to the system with a randomly generated ticket ID.  
- **Cancel Ticket:** Remove the ticket at the front of the queue (FIFO).  
- **View All Bookings:** Display a list of all active tickets and passenger names.  
- **Check Booking Status:** See the total number of tickets currently booked.  
- **Exit Safely:** Allows graceful program termination.

***

## ⚙️ Data Structure Used

- **Circular Queue:** Implemented using a fixed-size array of structures.  
- Each structure (`Ticket`) includes:
  - `ticketID`: A random unique ID.
  - `name`: Passenger's name.

Queue handling is managed using two indices — **front** and **rear** — which wrap around using modular arithmetic when the array end is reached.

***

## 🧠 Concept Demonstrated

This project applies the **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** queue logic through:
- `bookTicket()` → Enqueue operation  
- `cancelTicket()` → Dequeue operation  
- `displayBookings()` → Traversing queue circularly  
- `showStatus()` → Counting current queue elements  

It’s a perfect educational example to understand **circular queue implementation** in C and **queue-based system simulations**.
